## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learn how to combine min-width and max-width media queries in order to target a range of specific viewport sizes. I also further increased my knowledge of CSS background images.

### Continued development

I would like to further increase my knowledge of using CSS grid to layout my elements on the page.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Introduction Controlling background-images | CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This helped me use mutliple background iamges for my body in CSS and will use it going forward.
